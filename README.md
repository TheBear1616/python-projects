# Python Projects

This repository contains a collection of Python projects that I have worked on for learning and practicing purposes. Each project is contained in its own directory with the necessary source code files and other related resources.

### Budget Tracker

The Budget Tracker is a simple command-line application that allows you to track your expenses against a set budget. You can add expenses, view the remaining balance, and save/load the budget data to/from a JSON file.

**Files**:

- `budget-data.json` (Sample budget data in JSON format)
- `budget-tracker.py` (Python source code)

### Hangman Game

This is a classic implementation of the Hangman word-guessing game. The computer randomly selects a programming language word, and the player has to guess the letters one by one. The game keeps track of the remaining attempts and displays the current state of the word.

**Files**:

- `hangman.py` (Python source code)

### Quiz Game

The Quiz Game is a simple command-line application that presents a set of multiple-choice questions to the user. The user selects their answer, and the game keeps track of the score. At the end, the final score is displayed.

**Files**:

- `quiz-game.py` (Python source code)

### Language Learning Flashcards App

This project is a simple command-line application that quizzes the user on translating Kannada words to English. It presents a random set of five words from a predefined list, and the user has to provide the English translation. At the end of the quiz, the user's score is displayed.

**Files**:

- `language-flashcards.py` (Python source code)

## Usage

To run any of the projects, navigate to the respective project directory and execute the Python file using the following command:<br>
